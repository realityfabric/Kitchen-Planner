# About ReadyChef

There are two key components to the database:
* ingredients in a person's stock
* ingredients in recipes

At its most basic, this program should be able to recommend recipes to a person based on ingredients they already have.

Further goals:
* Prioritize recipes with ingredients which are near or past their Best By date.
* Filter recipes based on dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, kosher, etc).
* Filter recipes based on allergies.
* Keep track of recipes that the user likes, and dislikes. This could potentially be used to predict recipes a user will like.
